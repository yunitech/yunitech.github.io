    <h1>Welcome to Yunitech</h1>

    <p>Hey there! I'm Yuniel, a game developer and Unreal Engine programmer with a passion for technology and innovation.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm originally from Cuba and currently based in Budva, Montenegro. I hold a degree in Psychology, but technology, programming, and science fiction have always been my true calling. My journey has led me to focus on game development, specializing in Unreal Engine and C++.</p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>Most of my time is spent programming game systems, experimenting with Unreal Engine’s Gameplay Ability System (GAS), and pushing my skills in both C++ and Blueprint scripting. I love bringing complex gameplay mechanics to life, exploring AI behaviors, and ensuring immersive, interactive experiences in games.</p>
    <p>I currently work for a game developer where I am responsible for <strong>sound implementation</strong> and <strong>gameplay mechanics</strong> in our projects. Alongside, I manage a private Telegram group, <strong>Game_Dev_Elite</strong>, for collaboration with other passionate developers.</p>

    <h2>Key Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Unreal Engine C++ and Blueprint, GAS, AI programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> C#, Java, Arduino, Android Development.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Collaboration:</strong> Teamwork and communication with creatives to bridge technical and design elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Psychology in Games:</strong> Leveraging my psychology background to create engaging and meaningful player experiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p>I’m always looking to improve my skills and connect with like-minded developers. Currently, I'm working on personal projects, growing my programming expertise, and guiding beginners in Unreal Engine through tutorials and support. Long-term, I aim to build a studio with a team of passionate, innovative minds.</p>
