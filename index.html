                <p>Hello! I'm Yuniel, a passionate Unreal Engine Programmer. I have always been fascinated by technology and innovation. My introduction to Java and Android app development sparked my interest in programming. This led me to explore other platforms, including Arduino, where I discovered the intersection of hardware and software.

            <p>
            As I delved deeper into game development, I was drawn to C# and Unity Engine. My project recreating key gameplay mechanics from Red Alert II allowed me to apply my understanding of programming concepts to a new domain. This experience strengthened my foundation in Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns.
            In Unreal Engine, I've honed my skills in gameplay mechanics using Blueprints and C++. I've also gained expertise with the Gameplay Ability System (GAS), enabling me to create complex, customizable game mechanics that seamlessly integrate with other systems.
            Throughout my journey, I've developed a proactive attitude, strong communication skills, and a problem-solving approach. I'm committed to continuous learning, seeking opportunities to improve my skills and learn from others.
            I'm excited about the opportunity to share my passion for game development with like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects that drive innovation and push the boundaries of game development.</p>
