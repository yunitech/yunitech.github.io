# Welcome to Yunitech

Hey there! I'm Yuniel, a game developer and Unreal Engine programmer with a passion for technology and innovation.

## About Me
I'm originally from Cuba and currently based in Budva, Montenegro. I hold a degree in Psychology, but technology, programming, and science fiction have always been my true calling. My journey has led me to focus on game development, specializing in Unreal Engine and C++.

## What I Do
Most of my time is spent programming game systems, experimenting with Unreal Engine’s Gameplay Ability System (GAS), and pushing my skills in both C++ and Blueprint scripting. I love bringing complex gameplay mechanics to life, exploring AI behaviors, and ensuring immersive, interactive experiences in games.

I currently work for a game developer where I am responsible for **sound implementation** and **gameplay mechanics** in our projects. Alongside, I manage a private Telegram group, **Game_Dev_Elite**, for collaboration with other passionate developers.

## Key Skills
- **Game Development:** Unreal Engine C++ and Blueprint, GAS, AI programming.
- **Technical Expertise:** C#, Java, Arduino, Android Development.
- **Creative Collaboration:** Teamwork and communication with creatives to bridge technical and design elements.
- **Psychology in Games:** Leveraging my psychology background to create engaging and meaningful player experiences.

## What’s Next
I’m always looking to improve my skills and connect with like-minded developers. Currently, I'm working on personal projects, growing my programming expertise, and guiding beginners in Unreal Engine through tutorials and support. Long-term, I aim to build a studio with a team of passionate, innovative minds.

Let’s connect, share knowledge, and push the boundaries of what's possible in game development!
