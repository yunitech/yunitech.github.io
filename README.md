# Welcome to Yunitech

Hey there! I'm Yuniel, a game developer and Unreal Engine programmer with a passion for technology and innovation.

## About Me
I'm originally from Cuba and currently based in Budva, Montenegro. Technology, programming, and science fiction have always been my true calling. My journey has led me to focus on game development, specializing in Unreal Engine and C++.

## What I Do
Most of my time is spent programming game systems, experimenting with Unreal Engine’s Gameplay Ability System (GAS), and pushing my skills in both C++ and Blueprint scripting. I love bringing complex gameplay mechanics to life, exploring AI behaviors, and ensuring immersive, interactive experiences in games.

I currently work for a game developer where I am responsible for **sound implementation** and **gameplay mechanics** in our projects. Alongside, I manage a private Telegram group, **Unreal_Dev_Alliance**, for collaboration with other passionate developers.

## Key Skills
- **Unreal Engine 5.0 and above**: Extensive experience with UE5, including advanced gameplay mechanics, performance optimization, and debugging.
- **Proficient in C++ and Blueprints programming**: Skilled in writing efficient, maintainable C++ code and Blueprint scripting for gameplay, AI, and UI systems.
- **AI behavior programming**: Behavioral Trees, Environment Query System (EQS), and Senses.
- **Gameplay Ability System (GAS) Integration**: In-depth experience with GAS, including custom ability setup, event-driven activations, and modular gameplay systems.
- **Troubleshooting and Debugging**: Skilled in both the Unreal editor and C++ codebase, ensuring clean, bug-free development cycles.
- **Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns**: Applied OOP principles and design patterns to create scalable, reusable code architectures for gameplay systems.
- **Version Control Systems**: Proficient in Git, Unity Version Control (Plastic SCM), and branch management for collaborative development.
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Skilled in working within cross-functional teams, resolving complex technical challenges through iterative problem-solving and clear communication.

## What’s Next
I’m always looking to improve my skills and connect with like-minded developers. Currently, I'm working on personal projects, growing my programming expertise, and guiding beginners in Unreal Engine through tutorials and support. Long-term, I aim to build a studio with a team of passionate, innovative minds.

Let’s connect, share knowledge, and push the boundaries of what's possible in game development!
